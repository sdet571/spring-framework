     * BootStrapping the application:
     * Because we will be running the application from an executable JAR, it is important to have a main class that will
     * be executed when that JAR file is run.
     * @SpringBootApplication: is a composite annotation that combines the following annotations:
     *     路 @SpringBootConfiguration: Designates this class as a configuration class. We can add Java based Spring framework
     *       configuration to this class if we need to. This annotation is specialized form of the @Configuration annotation
     *     路 @EnableAutoConfiguration: Enables Spring Boot automatic configuration. It tells Spring Boot to automatically
     *       configure components that it think we will need
     *     路 @ComponentScan: Enables component scanning. This lets us declare other classes with annotation like @Component
     *       to have Spring automatically discover and register them as components in the Spring application context.
     * 路 main() method: calls a static run method on SpringApplication class, which performs the actual bootstrapping
     *     on the application, creating the Spring application context. The 2 parameters passed to run() method are a
     *     configuration class, and the command line arguments.
